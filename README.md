# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning

Introduction :
Stock market analysis/prediction is considering to be the most sophisticated area specifically managed by “Fund Manager” who are providing bespoke services to institutional investors via institutions such as Hedge funds, Funds of Funds and others and other investment vehicles. Traditionally these Hedge fund managers used to perform analysis or create a strategy mainly by analyzing past financial reports, market performance and come to a conclusion what position to take for that specific security or asset class. However over the years with a tremendous increase in the amount of financial data the traditional approach for analysis and shortlisting different strategies for picking stocks is changed and a new field is emerged called Quantitative Finance. First thing first what is Quantitative Finance?

Quantitative finance is a field of applied mathematics, concerned with mathematical modelling of financial markets. To simply put we use past financial data to come up with a strategy which will let us predict a future trend or the price of an asset class.

My main aim of this post is to provide very beginners with a basic overview as to how we can use basic machine learning models on stock market data to predict future trends. To make things simple here we will only consider single attribute i.e stock price to analyze the trend of stock (Please note to get a model into production in the practical world it involves more than single attributes into consideration)
